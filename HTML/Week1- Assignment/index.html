      <strong> Biography:</strong>
      <p>
        My name is Kazeem, and I am currently a student at ALT School Africa,
        where I am pursuing a diploma in cloud computing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold a Bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering, and I've further
        advanced my academic journey with a Master's degree in Artificial
        Intelligence and Data Science. These two fields have equipped me with a
        unique blend of analytical thinking, structured problem-solving, and
        data-driven decision-making skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am 30 years old and currently reside in the United Kingdom, where I
        continue to seek new learning opportunities, and prepare for a global
        tech career.

      <strong> Why am I at ALT School? </strong>
      <p>
        My interest in cloud computing emerged from observing current trends in
        technology and future skill demands. Through personal research and
        exploration, I discovered that cloud computing is one of the most
        critical and in-demand skills for professionals working in AI, Data
        Science, and software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose to study at ALT School because of its strong reputation and
        commitment to helping students transition into tech careers. The
        school's project-based approach and community-driven learning
        environment made it stand out among other options.
      </p>
      <p>
        My specific focus is on DevOps, with a deep interest in MLOps (Machine
        Learning Operations). I believe MLOps offers the bridge between data
        science and real-world deployment. It allows machine learning models to
        be production-ready, scalable, and maintainable. I'm also eager to learn
        how to manage, automate, and monitor cloud infrastructure, especially
        within AWS, which is widely used in industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to DevOps, I want to build expertise in cloud-native
        development, application deployment, CI/CD pipelines, and container
        orchestration using tools like Docker and Kubernetes
      </p>

      <strong> My Goals: </strong>
      <p>
        By the end of the programme, my main objective is to confidently design,
        build, and deploy scalable machine learning applications on the cloud,
        leveraging DevOps and MLOps best practices.
      </p>
      <p>Some of my specific goals include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Earning multiple <b>AWS certifications</b>, including the AWS
          Certified Solutions Architect and AWS Certified DevOps Engineer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mastering tools and platforms such as GitHub Actions, Terraform,
          Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS SageMaker
        </li>
        <li>
          Becoming proficient in managing both infrastructure and ML lifecycle
          using cloud services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Collaborating effectively with other learners and professionals to
          build strong relationships and grow my network.
        </li>
        <li>
          Securing a professional role as a DevOps Engineer or MLOps Engineer,
          where I can apply my combined skills in AI, data science, and cloud
          computing to solve real-world problems.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Ultimately, I hope to become a skilled engineer, who contributes
        positively to the global tech community.
